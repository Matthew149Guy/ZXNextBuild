Gold & gems are dropped when a big or medium rock is destroyed
Big rock - 25% chance of either
Med Rock - 20% chance of either
They move in a different direction to the rock
They have a lifetime
They do slow to a stop
There is a maximum number of gold/gems allowed on screen at the same time (I'd say one of each, or two of any)
