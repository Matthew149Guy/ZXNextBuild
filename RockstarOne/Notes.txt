Gold & gems are dropped when a big or medium rock is destroyed
Big rock - 25% chance of either
Med Rock - 20% chance of either
They move in a different direction to the rock
They have a lifetime
They do slow to a stop
There is a maximum number of gold/gems allowed on screen at the same time (I'd say one of each, or two of any)

Engine wash
x, y, dx, dy, animation counter

Two modes of friction
High/Thin Atmosphere - friction is applied
Deep Space - zero friction

Different backgrounds for each mode (maybe load background from SD Card)

Alien - Setting up - things to choose at random

1. Big Alien or Small Alien
2. Left to Right or Right to Left
3. Velocity and angle, +60 degrees, +45, +30, -30, -45, -60
4. Set y-bounding, alien inverts  y direction when it "bounces" on the y backgrounds
5. Alien is "dead" once gone off screen#
6. When shot, alien blows up and shows bonus score sprite, also 50% chance of a gem dropping as loot from small alien, big alien drops gold (50%)

Gold and Gem have a lifetime *20/30 seconds - they flash during glast 5 seconds

When starting a new level or a new player ship life, the ship has a grace period of n seconds where it cannot be destroyed - swap between ship and shield
