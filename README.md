### Starfield
A program to display a series of points on the screen in Layer 2 (320x256x8) that simulates the effect of a moving starfield or dust in 3 planes; near, mid-distance and far, each plane moving at a different velocity.
Direction of movement is controlled by the keys WSAD.

### Rockstar One
An example game based on the classic arcade "Asteroids", but using sprites instead of vector graphics. Movement is controlled by WSAD and L is the fire button (for now). This is a work in progress, many things to still add.
